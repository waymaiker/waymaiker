## Current Project
I'm working on a learning language app.  
Last year, I traveled and started to learn a new langugage. Back home, I tried to find an easy way to learn and practice.
I started developping an App, so that I could continue practicing what I already knew, while waiting to start a more formal course.

I finally found a great course which I started in September.
My main objectives are as follows:
 - To have all the vocabulary and the different type of exercices of the course, into the app.
 - To share the app with my classmates

This is currently an MVP, which could become a real app during the year.
